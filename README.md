# IntentKit Examples

This repository contains examples and demonstrations of [IntentKit](https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit), an open and fair framework for building AI agents equipped with powerful skills.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different type of IntentKit example, showcasing various capabilities and use cases of the framework.

### üìÅ Examples

#### `cli/`
A command-line interface example demonstrating how to interact with IntentKit agents programmatically. This example shows how to:
- Initialize and configure IntentKit agents
- Execute agent commands from the terminal
- Handle agent responses and outputs
- Integrate IntentKit into CLI workflows

#### `agent-api/`
**Special Note**: This folder contains subfolders that are examples of applications built using the [IntentKit Agent API](https://open.service.crestal.network/v1/redoc). These are "vibe coding apps" that demonstrate creative and innovative ways to leverage IntentKit's agent capabilities through its REST API.

Each subfolder within `agent-api/` represents a unique application example that:
- Utilizes the IntentKit Agent API endpoints
- Demonstrates different integration patterns
- Shows creative use cases and implementations
- Provides inspiration for building your own agent-powered applications
