# Chat UI
The most basic app is a chat UI just like ChatGPT

## 1. Get your agent api key

## 2. Using a vibe code platform

We recommend using vibe coding platforms like [Base44](https://base44.com/) or [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) for the easiest development experience. These AI-powered platforms can handle everything for you - from building the UI to setting up the backend infrastructure and deployment.

**Why use vibe coding platforms?**
- **No coding required**: Simply describe what you want in natural language
- **Instant deployment**: Your app goes live immediately after creation
- **Built-in hosting**: No need to worry about servers or infrastructure
- **Complete functionality**: Authentication, database, and integrations are handled automatically

If you have programming experience, you can alternatively use Cursor-like IDEs to code manually and handle your own deployment.


### Vibe coding Prompt:
Create a ChatGPT like UI, it can chat with my agent. Use fingerprintjs to get id for user_id.
The agent API doc is:
